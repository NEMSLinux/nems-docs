Notifications By SMS
====================

Many mobile service providers offer the ability to receive SMS messages
via an SMS Gateway. This means by sending an email to a special email
address provided by your phone service company, you will receive the
email as an SMS message.

Of course, this is ideal for NEMS Linux notifications.

Finding Your SMS Gateway Email Address
--------------------------------------

Rather than maintain a massive list here (reinventing the wheel), please
see `mfitzp's List of SMS
Gateways <https://github.com/mfitzp/List_of_SMS_gateways/blob/master/email2sms.csv>`__ CSV
file.

How To Configure
----------------

Simply `set your contact email
address <https://docs.nemslinux.com/config/contact-email>`__ in NEMS
NConf to the appropriate SMS Gateway address.
