Security
~~~~~~~~

For convenience and usability, NEMS TV Dashboard does not prompt for
your NEMS username and password by default. If you prefer to keep the
Dashboard private, please open `NEMS
SST <https://docs.nemslinux.com/config/nems_sst>`__ and turn off “Allow
TV Dashboard Without Password” - but make sure you have a keyboard
connected to your TVs (or something like VNC access).

Under The Hood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEMS TV Dashboard uses the Check_MK Livestatus socket in the back-end,
making it fast, efficient, and lightweight.
