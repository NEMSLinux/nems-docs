Generate NEMS Config: Make Your Changes Live
============================================

To make your changes live, press the *Generate NEMS Config* link on the left navigation. You should see 0 errors. If you do see errors, review where you went wrong, make the necessary changes, and try again. NConf is very good at showing you where the error is so you can go back and fix it rather quickly.
