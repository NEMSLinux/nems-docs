Connecting to Your NEMS Server
==============================

Now that your NEMS Linux server is up and running, you can access its entire feature set via your web browser. Simply point to https://nems.local/ which should work in most networks out of the box, but if you need to, you can alternatively use the IP address of your NEMS server.
